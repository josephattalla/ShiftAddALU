# ShiftAddALU
A Verilog-based Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) supporting shift, addition, and subtraction operations, implemented and tested on the Terasic DE1-SoC FPGA development board using Quartus and simulated on ModelSim. Uses the switches and buttons on the board as input. Implemented a hex driver to display results on the board with block diagrams.
